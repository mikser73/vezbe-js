# Assignment

The assignment is to complete 11 simple javascript exercises. Each exercise has the
implementation (in src file) and test (in spec  file ). You need to write the appropriate code in the src file to make the test work. The test will show you what are the expected functionalities that an exercise must implement. The text of the exercise is given as the comment in the implementation file.
To run the tests for an exercise, just open the runner.html file present in each exercise folder in a browser of your choice, and it will run the tests for you and tell you if they pass (all green) or fail (red).

## Tasks
